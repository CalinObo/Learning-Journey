Name the three ways to declare a variable.
The three ways are var, let, const.

Which of three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
We should avoid the var declaration, sometimes the behavior of var is not what you would expect.

What rules should you follow when naming variables?

There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:
-the name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _
-the first character must not be a digit.

When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used.

What happens when you add numbers and strings together?

They concatenate, here are some examples:
'1'+2 = 12  2+'1' =21 '1' +2+2 =122
If there are numbers in the first part of our exercise and later there`s a string, the string will be concatenated to the result of the operations before it.
2+2+'1'= 41 

How does the Modulo (%), or Remainder, operator work?
The result of a%b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.
8%3=2
10%3=1

Explain the difference between == and ===.

The == operator checks for the same value.
The === operator checks for the same value and type.

When would you receive a NaN result?

Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN(not a number).However, if the string is numeric, the result will be a number.

How do you increment and decrement a number?

We make use of the ++ and -- operator.

Explain the difference between prefixing and postfixing increment/decrement operators.

If we`d like to increase a value and immediately use the result of the operator, we need the prefix form.
If we`d like to increment a value but use its previous value, we need the postfix form.

What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?

If an expression has more than one operator, the execution order is defined by their precedence, or, in other words, the default priority order of operators.
From school, we all know that the multiplication should be calculated before the addition. That`s exactly the precedence thing. The multiplication is said to have 
a higher precedence than the addition.
Parentheses override any precedence, so if we`re not satisfied with the default order, we can use them to change it.

How do you acces developer tools and the console?
Inspect element => console

How do you log information to the console?
console.log();

What does unary plus operator do to string represenations of integer? eg. +"10"
Transforms it into a number, it converts string to number.
