What is the difference between the child combinator and the descendant combinator?

The difference is that the child combinator will select the elements that are child of some other element, for example:
<article>
	<div><p>Lorem</p></div>
</article
<div><p>Ipsum</p></div>

article>div is a child combinator and will select Lorem, article +div is a descendant combinator and will select Ipsum.


How does the syntax of pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements differ?

Pseudo-classes offer us different ways to target elements in our html. Some are base on their position or structure 
within the html. Others are based on the state of a particular element, or how the user is currently interacting with it.
Some examples are :focus :link :hover :active :visited. 

Pseudo elements are more abstract, they allow us to affect patrs of our html that aren`t elements at all.
Some examples are ::marker ::first-letter ::first-line ::selection ::before and ::after

As a rule, double colons (::) should be used instead of a single colon(:). This distinguishes pseudo-classe from pseudo-elements.

Do pseudo-classes exist somewhere in HTML? Do pseudo-elements?
Yes they both do.
