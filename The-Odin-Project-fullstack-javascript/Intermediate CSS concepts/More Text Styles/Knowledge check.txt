What are the 2 ways to add fonts that are not installed on a user`s computer?

We can use an online font library like Google Fonts, Font Library or other services, to use a font from on of these libraries,
we go to the website, select a font and then copy a snippet from the website to import that font from their server
into our website. We`ll be given either a <link> tag to put in our html like.
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

Or an import tag that can be dropped at the top of a CSS file.
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap');

What is the 'system font stack' and why would you want to use it?

The system font stack is the the font that the operating system is already using. We would want to use it because
defaulting to the system font of a particular operating system can boost performance 
because the browser doesn`t have to download any font files, it`s using the one it already had.

Which property would you use to increase or decrease the space between letters in a word?

We would use letter-spacing.

Which property would you use to increase or decrease the space between lines in a paragraph?

We would use line-height.
