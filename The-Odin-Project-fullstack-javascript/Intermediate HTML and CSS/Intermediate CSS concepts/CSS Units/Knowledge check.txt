Why would you want to use em or rem for font-size instead of px?

1em is the font size of an element (or the element`s parents if I`m using it to set font-size).
1rem is the font size of the root element (either:root or html).
The recommended unit to use is rem since many browsers allow users to change the base font-size to increase readability.
Using rem,the change to the base font-size will apply to all of our elements.
It`s is better to use em or rem rather than px, because they adapt to the device`s width, it`s more responsive.
If we use px we will have to make sure that the change looks good on all of the devices (media queries etc.)

What a some instances where you might want to use vh an vw?

Some of the instances in which we would want to use vh and vw are:
-set a minimum and maxium view height or witdh for text. We can also responsive typography with the calc() formula so that the changes in view will not be drastic.
-to constrain our application to the height of the viewport with a single declaration on the body element, height:100vh. We have to make sure to apply overflow values on internal elements, so our content isn`t cut off.
-we can create a sticky footer with min-height:100 so that the footer will stay in place at the bottom of our screen until it`s pushed down by content.
-we can apply height, min-height, or max-height of various elements to create full-screen sections, hero images and more.
-to have fluid aspect ratios, it also comes in handy when we have videos on our webpage.
-to break the container
-they are mainly used with the calc formula so that the content we are seeing changes accordingly to the size of the screen.

What are some instances where you might want to use px instead of relative unit?

We might want to use pixels in everything, pixel is a absolut unit size, while em changes according to it`s parent`s size. The em can get troublesome since one change can affect the whole page.
One point of view is to use rem for font-size and px for everything else.
