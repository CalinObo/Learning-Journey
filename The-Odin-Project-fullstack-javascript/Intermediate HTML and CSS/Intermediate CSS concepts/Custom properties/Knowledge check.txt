How would you declare a custom property with a name of text-color?

We could declare it with --text-color. We have to use it inside of root in order to make it globally.
root:
{
	--text-color:blue;
}

How would you acces a custom property with a name of background-color?

We could acces it by using var(). For example we could have 
p{
	color:var(--text-color,yellow);
}
We can also add a fallback value in case that the --text-color property doesn`t work. In our case the fallback is yellow.

Where would you declare a custom property to have its scope be global and accessible by all other selectors?

We could declare it in the root selector :root{}.

Where would you declare a custom property so that a user`s theme setting from their OS or browser was taken into account?
We would declare it in the root selector. We could add a class to our html element so that it would have a default class.
After that we cand add on our root selector using :root.dark/:root.light custom properties.
We can also make use of media query using @media(prefes-color-scheme:dark). Keep in mind that this works only with dark and light.
