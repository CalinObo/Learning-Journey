What does the required validation do?

It tells us that the input is required, to ensure a good user experience and to meet acessibility guidelines,
we sould always indicate which fields are required. This will often be done by adding an asterisk(*) to the required field
label like we have done in the examples throughout the chapter.

What validations can you use for checking text length?

We can use the minlength or maxlength attribute with an integer value that represents the minimum amount or maximum
amount of charachters we want to allow in the form control.

How can you validate the minimum and maximum of numeric inputs?

The same way we do for checking text length only that instead of minlength/maxlength we use min/max attributes.

What can you use the pattern validation for?

We use pattern validation in order to ensure we get the correct information from users, we will often want to ensure data matches a particular pattern.
Real-world applicatons would be checking if a credit car number or a zip code is in the correct format.
We can use it for many things, one example would be to have a phone number entered in different methods, such as 1231231234/123 123 1234/123-123-1234/123/123/1234.
Regex is the way.

What pseudo CSS selectors are available for styling valid and invalid inputs?

We can use :valid or :invalid. We have examples of using these selectors in the form example.
