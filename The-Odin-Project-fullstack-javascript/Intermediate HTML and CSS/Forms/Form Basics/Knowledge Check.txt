Explain what the form element is for and two attributes it should always include.

The form element is a container element like the div element. The form element wraps all of the inputs a user will interact with on a form.
The form element accepts two essential attributes:
- the first is the action attribute which takes a URL value that tells the form where it should send its data to be processed.
- the second is the method attribute which tells the browser which HTTP request method it should use to submit the form. The most
  used one are get and post.

Explain what form controls are at a high level.

In order to start collecting user data, we need to use form control elements. These are all the elements users will interact with on the form.
Some examples are:
-inputs which can be of all kinds, it can ask for text, number, email addreses. We can also have radioboxes and checkboxes.
-textarea in which we can ask the user to type something more than his/her name.
-meter bars/progress bars which show the progress of a questionnaire for example
-file pickers, in case we want the user to upload a file 
-select elements in which we give to possibility to the user to choose from a list of predefined options
- last but not least, buttons which can be of 3 kinds:submit,reset and button. Each button doing something different.

What is the name attribute for?
The name attribute serves as a reference to the data inputted into a form control after submitting it.
I did a few examples in which we have submitted the data to "http://httpbin.org/post" and we can see that the name attribute is shown
among the user input. We can think of it as a variable name for the input. Form input should always have a name attribute; otherwise,
it will be ignored when the form is submitted. It`s worth mentiong that radiobuttons should have the same name, they are part of a groups
so that when one of them gets selected the other one gets unselected.
