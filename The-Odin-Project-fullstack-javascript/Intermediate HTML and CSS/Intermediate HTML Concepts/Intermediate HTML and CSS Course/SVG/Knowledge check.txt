xlmns- stands for "XML NameSpace. This specifies what dialect of xml you`re using.In our case, the dialect is the SVG language spec.
Without it, some browsers will not render your image or will render it incorrectly.

What are some situations where you wouldn`t want to use SVG?
The situations in which I would not use SVG are when I try to render more detailed pictures, whether they have fine details or textures.
Then SVGs are not the tool for the job.

What are the benefits of "inlining" your SVGs? What are the drawbacks?
The benefits of inlining my SVG are:
-the SVG properties will be visible in my code, which will alow me to alter the image dinamically via CSS or JavaScript.
-it will unlock their full potential.
The drawbacks are:
-it will make the code harder to read.
-if it`s a large SVG the page will load slower
-it`ll make my page less cacheable
