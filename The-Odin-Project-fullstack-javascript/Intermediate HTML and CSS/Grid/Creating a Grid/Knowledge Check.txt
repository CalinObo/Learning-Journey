How does an HTML element become a grid item?

In CSS, an element is turned into a grid container with the property display: grid or display: inline-grid.
In the example we`ve done, the parent element marked class="container" becomes a grid container and each of the 
direct child eleemnts below it automatically become grid items.

What is the space between lines on the grid?

The space between lines on the grid is called grid item.

How do you set gutters (also known as alleys) in the grid?

The gap between grid rows and columns is known as the gutter or alley. Gap sizes can be adjusted separately
for rows and column using the column-gap and row-gap properties. Furthermore, we can use a shorthand property
called gap to set both row-gap and column-gap.

Describe what happens when you have more content than defined tracks.

The items that are added in our grid and for which we have not defined the row or the column, will be slotted into a new row.
This is because of the implicit grid concept and it`s how CSS grid is able to automatically place grid items
when we haven`t explicitly defined the layout for them.

How could you change the size for those undefined tracks?

We can set the implicit grid track sizes using the grid-auto-rows and grid-auto column properties.
In this way we can ensure any new tracks the implicit grid makes for extra content are set at values that we defined.
