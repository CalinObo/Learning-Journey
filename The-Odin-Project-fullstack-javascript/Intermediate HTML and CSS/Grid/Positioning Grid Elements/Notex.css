header area. The middle row will be composed of two main areas, one empty cell, and one sidebar area. The last row is all footer.

Each row in your declaration needs to have the same number of cells. You can use any number of adjacent periods to declare a single empty cell.
As long as the periods have no spaces betwenn them they represent a single cell.

Notice that you`re not naming lines with this syntax, just areas. When you use this syntax the lines on either end of the areas are actually getting named automatically.
If the name of your grid area is foo, the name of the area`s starting row line and starting column line will be foo-start, and the name of its last row line and last column will be foo-end.
This means that some lines might have multiple names, such as the far left line in the above example, which will have three names: header-start,main-start and footer-start.

Aligns grid items along the inline(row) axis (as opposed to align-items which aligns along the block (column) axis).

-end- aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell
-center-aligns items in the center of their cell
-stretch- fills the whole width of the cell(this is the default)

Sometimes the total size of your grid might be less than the size of its grid container. This could happen if all of

-center-aligns the grid in the center of the grid container
-stretch- resizes the grid items to allow the grid to fill the full width of the grid container
-space-around- places an even amount of space between each grid item, with no space at the far ends
