When might you use Flexbox over Grid?

In Content First Deignm you begin with clarity of how the content should be, and the layout follows. This is a great
opportunity to use Flexbox. Its flexbile nature gives you control of the behavior of items through logical rules. How
they grow, shrink, their ideal size and position in relation to each other, all make the layout dynamic. While Flexbox
gives you control over it`s content, the final layout is only a consequence. Depending on the dimensions of the flex 
container, the general layout can change a lot.

Content First vs Layout First Design

When might you use Grid over Flexbox?

A way to decide between Grid and Flexbox is to consider if your design starts from the content, or from the layout.
In Layout First Design, you decide how you want the pieces arranged, then fill in the content. That is when Grid shines.
Defining grid row and column tracks gives you full control of layout. Content in a grid can only fill the spaces of explicit
or implicit tracks. So when you have an idea of how the big picture of a container should look like, Grid is the clear choice.

When might you use the two of these tools together?

If you have one-dimensional content, Flexbox can make it easier to control how that content is positioned in a Flex container. If, on the other hand, you want to
accurately place content on a complex layout in two-diensions, Grid can be simpler to use.
Say you want your overall layout to be a grid, but you want the grid items to act as flex parents.
This way, the grid items can be moved around using the precise two-dimensional placement Grid allows for, 
while also allowing the content inside the grid items to be capable of freely moving around using Flex.
