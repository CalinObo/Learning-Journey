{   Now, you will work on opening and closing the form modal.

    In earlier projects, you learned how to add and remove classes from an element with el.classList.add() and el.classList.remove().
    Another method to use with the classList property is the toggle method.

    The toggle method will add the class if it is not present on the element, and remove the class if it is present on the element.

    element.classList.toggle("class-to-toggle");
    Add an event listener to the openTaskFormBtn element and pass in a click event for the first argument and an empty callback function for the second argument.

    For the callback function, use the classList.toggle() method to toggle the hidden class on the taskForm element.

    Now you can click on the "Add new Task" button and see the form modal.

{
    The findIndex() array method finds and returns the index of the first element in an array that meets the criteria specified by a provided testing function. If no such element is found, the method returns -1.

    Here's an example:

    const numbers = [3, 1, 5, 6];
    const firstNumLargerThanThree = numbers.findIndex((num) => num > 3);

    console.log(firstNumLargerThanThree); // prints index 2
}

{
    Date.now() returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

    console.log(Date.now()); // 1628586800000
