There are different approaches to which we could use props.
The first approach would be to have in the app.js file multiple props with different names and pass through each value
a different prop
        App.js
      <ExpenseItem
        title={expenses[0].title}
        amount={expenses[0].amount}
        date={expenses[0].date}
      >

        Component.js
        function ExpenseItem(props)
        <h2>{props.title}</h2>

The second approach would be that, instead of passing the individuals values through multiple props we could pass the entire data point.
        App.js
        <ExpenseItem expense={expenses[0]}></ExpenseItem>
With this approach we also have the change the code in the  component.
        props.expense.title

The third approach is exclusive to the receiving component, we could object destructuring right in the paramater list.
Instead of using props, we could write exactly the properties that we want to use. Also this comes with changes in the component code
        // function ExpenseItem({date,title,amount})

        <h2>{title}</h2>
